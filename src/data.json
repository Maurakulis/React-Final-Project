So I was able to install it using install.packages(\"clock\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\") but then when I call library(clock) I get the error as seen in the picture below. I've seen the warning and that shouldn't be too much of an issue but i have not seen the error before and am unable to solve it. I was mainly intrested in using this package to change the timezone to local areas using 'date_zone()' and/or 'set_date_zone()'. I'm using version 4.2.1 if thats any help.",

About Perl, Python and Ruby, it is an Interview, they might be measuring your knowledge in other languages (if you heard about them, or if you know why .NET is better/worst).

All the ADO functionality has been out of date for about a decade now and there are some fine devs with years of experience that will just never have seen ADO.\n  I've hired a lot, and the difference between the really excellent candidates and the average ones is not what obscure things they know now, but what they can go pick up quickly when they need to. \n In short a really good developer might answer this with: \"I've never worked with ADO, but I could go find out\", which isn't that useful for you as interviewer.",
